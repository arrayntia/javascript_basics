Assignment Instruction!!!
The aim of this assignment is to help you practice the basic you've learned so far in Javascript. Instead of the inline Javascript added to the two buttons, you are to convert the event to internal Javascript.

Use the Javascript document model to target the two buttons and make them turn on and turn of the bulb when clicked.

Create intern script tag <script type="text/javascript"></script>
Give button 1 id of myBtn1
Use JavaScript document to target myBtn1 id and store in a const variable called btn1
Give the second button id of myBtn2
Use JavaScript document to target myBtn2 id and store in a const variable called btn2
Add event listener to each of the buttons and replace the image src attribute.
Make sure you remove the onclick attribute in the two button tags.
